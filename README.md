# Signp/Login Form - Frontend
Welcome to the Signup/Login Form project! This README file provides an overview of the project, including its features, setup instructions, and usage guidelines. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and was developed using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as the Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

Confirm Password Check: Validates that the confirmation password matches the original password.
Login Option: Provides an option for users to log in if they already have an account.
Picture Upload: Allows users to upload a profile picture. When the edit button is clicked, it triggers the upload function, and the uploaded picture is displayed correctly within the form.
